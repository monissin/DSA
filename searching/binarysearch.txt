BinarySearch using Built-in Methods in Java
1. Arrays.binarySearch()
    -> If input list is not sorted, the results are undefined.
    -> If there are duplicates, there is no guarantee which one will be found.
2. Collections.binarySearch()
    -> The method throws ClassCastException if elements of list are not comparable using the specified comparator,
    or the search key is not comparable with the elements.
