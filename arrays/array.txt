The idea of an array is to represent many instances in one variable.
Fixed size arrays are always allocated on heap.
Arraylist can be converted to fixed size array by specifying size while declaring.
ArrayList is a part of the collection framework and is present in java.util package

int intArray[];    //declaring array
intArray = new int[20];  // allocating memory to array

Vectors are very similar to ArrayList but Vector is synchronized and has some legacy method, which the collection framework does not contain.
It extends AbstractList and implements List interfaces.

Advantages of using Arrays:
Arrays allow random access to elements. This makes accessing elements by position faster.
Arrays have better cache locality which makes a pretty big difference in performance.
Arrays represent multiple data items of the same type using a single name.
Array data structures are used to implement the other data structures like linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.

Disadvantages of Array:
As arrays have a fixed size, once the memory is allocated to them, it cannot be increased or decreased, making it impossible to store extra data if required. An array of fixed size is referred to as a static array.
An array is homogeneous in nature so, a single array cannot store values of different data types.
Arrays store data in contiguous memory locations, which makes deletion and insertion very difficult to implement. This problem is overcome by implementing linked lists, which allow elements to be accessed randomly.

Application of Array:
They are used in the implementation of other data structures such as array lists, heaps, hash tables, vectors, and matrices.
Database records are usually implemented as arrays.
It is used in lookup tables by computer.
It is used for different sorting algorithms such as bubble sort insertion sort, merge sort, and quick sort.
