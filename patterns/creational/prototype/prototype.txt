Prototype Pattern says that cloning of an existing object instead of creating new one and can also be customized as per the requirement.
This pattern should be followed, if the cost of creating a new object is expensive and resource intensive.
Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.

Pros.
1. It reduces the need of sub-classing.
2. It hides complexities of creating objects.
3. You can clone objects without coupling to their concrete classes.

Cons.
1. Cloning complex objects that have circular references might be very tricky.
